 * Plasma::Theme provides access to a common and standardized set of graphic

 * of SVGs that will affect the look and feel of all workspace components.
 *
 * Plasma::Svg uses Plasma::Theme internally to locate and load the appropriate
 * SVG data. Alternatively, Plasma::Theme can be used directly to retrieve
 * file system paths to SVGs by name.
