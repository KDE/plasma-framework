 *
 * This is the base class for DataEngines, which provide access to bodies of
 * data via a common and consistent interface. The common use of a DataEngine
 * is to provide data to a widget for display. This allows a user interface
 * element to show all sorts of data: as long as there is a DataEngine, the
 * data is retrievable.
 *
 * DataEngines are loaded as plugins on demand and provide zero, one or more
 * data sources which are identified by name. For instance, a network
 * DataEngine might provide a data source for each network interface.
