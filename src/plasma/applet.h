/**
 * @class Applet plasma/applet.h <Plasma/Applet>
 *
 * @short The base Applet class
 *
 * Applet provides several important roles for add-ons widgets in Plasma.
 *
 * First, it is the base class for the plugin system and therefore is the
 * interface to applets for host applications. It also handles the life time
 * management of data engines (e.g. all data engines accessed via
 * Applet::dataEngine(const QString&) are properly deref'd on Applet
 * destruction), background painting (allowing for consistent and complex
 * look and feel in just one line of code for applets), loading and starting
 * of scripting support for each applet, providing access to the associated
 * plasmoid package (if any) and access to configuration data.
 *
 * See techbase.kde.org for tutorials on writing Applets using this class.
